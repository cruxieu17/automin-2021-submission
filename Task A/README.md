This is Task-A -
1. Open 'prepare_data_a.ipynb' and excecute the cells. Depending on whether you need to process a single transcript or batch-process multiple transcripts, execute the functions process_single() and batch_process(), respectively as decribed in the notebook.
2. If the model isn't fine-tuned, use 'bart_finetuning.ipynb' to run the huggingface trainer and evaluate if required. A sample usage of the pipeline has been provided at the end.
3. After all the requirements are met, open 'TASK-A.ipynb' and execute the cells to generate and save a meeting minute for processed transcript(s).
